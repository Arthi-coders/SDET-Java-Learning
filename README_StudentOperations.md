# StudentOperations – Java Methods & Arrays Project

This Java project demonstrates the use of **methods** and **arrays** to perform basic student operations:
- Calculate total marks
- Determine grade based on score
- Print output using reusable functions

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Java methods (`void` and `return`)
- Method parameters and loops
- Arrays and `for` loop traversal
- `if-else` control structures

## 🧑‍💻 Program Features
- Accepts an array of marks: `int[] marks = {85, 90, 72, 60};`
- Calculates total marks using a `sum()` method
- Prints each student's grade using `printGrade(int marks, int studentNumber)`

## ✅ Sample Output
```
Student marks (Total): 307
Student 1: Grade B
Student 2: Grade A
Student 3: Grade C
Student 4: Grade C
```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Copy the code into a file named `StudentOperations.java`
2. Compile and run using your Java IDE or terminal:
   ```
   javac StudentOperations.java
   java StudentOperations
   ```
