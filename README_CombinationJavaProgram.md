# CombinationJavaProgram – Array Practice in Java

This Java program demonstrates multiple common operations performed on arrays. It showcases the use of loops, conditions, and array properties to build simple and reusable utility methods.

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Looping through arrays using `for`
- Conditional checks (`% 2 == 0`, `% 2 != 0`)
- Accessing array elements with `nums[i]`
- Reversing an array using `for` loop (from `length - 1` to `0`)
- Summing all elements of an array

## 🧑‍💻 Program Features
- ✅ `Even()` method: Prints all even numbers in the array
- ✅ `odd()` method: Prints all odd numbers in the array
- ✅ `Sumofarray()` method: Prints all values in reverse and calculates the total sum

## 🧪 Sample Array
```java
int nums[] = {10, 15, 20, 25, 30};
```

## ✅ Sample Output
```
Find Even numbers:
nums[0] = 10
nums[2] = 20
nums[4] = 30

Find Odd numbers:
nums[1] = 15
nums[3] = 25

Reverse order and sum of array:
nums[4] = 30
nums[3] = 25
nums[2] = 20
nums[1] = 15
nums[0] = 10
Total Sum = 100
```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Save as `CombinationJavaProgram.java`
2. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   javac CombinationJavaProgram.java
   java CombinationJavaProgram
   ```
