# StudentReport – Java Program Using Arrays & Logic

This Java program simulates a simple **Student Report System**. It demonstrates real-world logic using arrays, loops, methods, and conditional statements. The program calculates total marks, average, and grade based on input marks for multiple students.

---

## 📘 Concepts Covered
- Array declaration and access
- Enhanced `for-each` loop
- Methods with parameters and return values
- Calculating total and average
- Conditional logic for grade assignment
- Type casting using `(double)` for accurate average
- Clean output formatting

## 🧑‍💻 Program Features

| Method Name         | Description                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `getTotal()`        | Sums up all the marks from an array                 |
| `getAverage()`      | Returns average by dividing total by array length   |
| `getGrade()`        | Returns grade (A, B, C, Fail) based on average      |
| `printReport()`     | Prints name, marks, total, average, and grade       |

## 🔍 Sample Input

```java
String student1 = "Arthi";
int[] marks1 = {85, 90, 78};
sr.printReport(student1, marks1);
```
