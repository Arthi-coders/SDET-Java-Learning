## üìò Programs Included

| Method               | Description                                                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `checkEvenOdd()`     | Checks if a number is even or odd using `%` operator             |
| `isPrime()`          | Determines if a number is a prime number                         |
| `getFactorial()`     | Calculates factorial using a `for` loop                          |
| `isPalindrome()`     | Checks if a string is the same forward and backward              |
| `swapNumbers()`      | Swaps two integers without using a third variable                |

## üßë‚Äçüíª Sample Usage in `main()`
```java
LogicPrograms Logical =  new LogicPrograms();
Logical.checkEvenOdd(10);
Logical.isPrime(5);
Logical.getFactorial(4);
Logical.isPalindrome("Megha");
Logical.swapNumbers(242, 243);
```

---

## ‚úÖ Sample Output
```
10 is Even Number
5 is a Prime number
24 is a factorial Number
Megha is a palidrom
Before Swap: a = 242, b = 243
After Swap: a = 243, b = 242

```

---

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Save as `LogicPrograms.java`
2. Compile and run:
```bash
javac LogicPrograms.java
java LogicPrograms
```
