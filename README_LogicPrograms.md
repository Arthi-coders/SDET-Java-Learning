## üìò Programs Included

| Method               | Description                                                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `checkEvenOdd()`     | Checks if a number is even or odd using `%` operator             |
| `isPrime()`          | Determines if a number is a prime number                         |
| `getFactorial()`     | Calculates factorial using a `for` loop                          |
| `isPalindrome()`     | Checks if a string is the same forward and backward              |
| `swapNumbers()`      | Swaps two integers without using a third variable                |

## üßë‚Äçüíª Sample Usage in `main()`
```java
LogicPrograms logic = new LogicPrograms();
logic.checkEvenOdd(10);
logic.isPrime(7);
logic.getFactorial(5);
logic.isPalindrome("madam");
logic.swapNumbers(5, 10);
```

---

## ‚úÖ Sample Output
```
10 is Even Number
7 is a Prime Number
Factorial of 5 is: 120
madam is a Palindrome
Before Swap: a = 5, b = 10
After Swap: a = 10, b = 5
```

---

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Save as `LogicPrograms.java`
2. Compile and run:
```bash
javac LogicPrograms.java
java LogicPrograms
```
